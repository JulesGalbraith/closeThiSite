        This calendar is the effort of many friends and artists with the 
        belief that the revolutions of the past continue to inspire and inform 
        the resistance of the future. The dates marked in this calendar are not exhaustive,
         but rather an effort of memory and commemoration. There are countless omissions 
         and this reflects on the limits of time and capacity in the compilation, rather 
         than historical priority or importance. If there is a date that we may have missed, 
         please mark it, remember it, honour it, and share it with others.&#10084; May we collectively be the keepers of our histories. 
        </p><br>
        <p class="calendar-copy">Many events listed were imperial campaigns that attempted to violently
             suppress the rights of the people of the global majority. These instances of repression are included
              with a view to mourning and education, rather than celebration. We invite you to research the events 
              listed each day, to learn more about these events,, to be enraged, and to feel pride and solidarity with 
              these legacies of resistance.
