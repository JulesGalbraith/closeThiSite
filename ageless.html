      <i>in retreat i forget that i am not ageless</i> </p> 
<pre>
    evening ginseng, ease and friction. 
    pricked nightskin, pocketing envy 
    on-call in long sebaceous life
    
    submerging again, the exit, come, on—
    now integrating after the prior interruption
    the ledge, now rounded, now waxed,
    
    blastform, ratio of softspeaking destruction
    to remainder rolling remnants between
    desperate fingertips, willing oilcling
    meet piecing, speak
    
    reinforcements cease at the sacrum
    spiral in a direction, becoming
    the devolution of orientation,
    
    welcome frilled and trilling infinities
    of unrest and restless material,
    strung, naped to the clip, the line,
    length and abandon, still trembling,
    a labile resistance, ongoing
    
    I was good in your presence
    in my own, presences, all of them
    ever-lattice, now-wind between
    thickbarrel boughs, staunch presents
    
    pregazing, ante-hension
    on the peripheries of disconnect, sensation, otherwise
    all that soaked through, dismembered inclemence
    
    hung stem to slice, the deviate fruiting
    all over, hands pre-worn since daybreak
    the earliest grip came strong, thumbridge, indent to burst
    
    never sat knowing near enough
    to meet and make in facing,
    fruitful and unsought, instead
    
    stress-tested an undeserving berry
    on a stalk on a vine on a bench
    in the corner in the way
    
    in the unutterable salience of inattention
    nearer nothing now, each expulsion
    blue and red, to gloss our affections
    
    forgive me this infirmity
    as ever spilling, domed vials, luxuriating
    in fluid misapprehension, the white strand
    
    silvering distance, retreating, nether
    the river and its occupants, damp-skinned,
    squealing, unused to meticulous disposal
    borne another decade into mortal knit and splitting
    
    cascade to quotidian altar, foot meets ground
    idolatrous stance, broad-shouldered,
    hung in well-traveled crevasses, the garment
    maintaining double aspect, more perhaps
    mirroring subduction in the atmosphere
    
    steam and doxa’s kisses sent on
    filling hearts, genera and foolish ores
    a fondness that curls around the waiting form
    deposing memory and its forthcoming, afterthought
    
    said a young man to a young man
    i’m an old man, full of regrets
    </pre>
