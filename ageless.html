      <i>in retreat i forget that i am not ageless</i> </h2> 
      <h3>originally published in NEW Journal for American Poetry, February 2023</h3>
    <p class="poemPara">
    evening ginseng, ease and friction. <br>
    pricked nightskin, pocketing envy <br>
    on-call in long sebaceous life</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    submerging again, the exit, come, on—<br>
    now integrating after the prior interruption<br>
    the ledge, now rounded, now waxed,</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    blastform, ratio of softspeaking destruction<br>
    to remainder rolling remnants between<br>
    desperate fingertips, willing oilcling<br>
    meet piecing, speak</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    reinforcements cease at the sacrum<br>
    spiral in a direction, becoming<br>
    the devolution of orientation,</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    welcome frilled and trilling infinities<br>
    of unrest and restless material,<br>
    strung, naped to the clip, the line,<br>
    length and abandon, still trembling,<br>
    a labile resistance, ongoing</p>
    
    <p class="poemPara">
    I was good in your presence<br>
    in my own, presences, all of them<br>
    ever-lattice, now-wind between<br>
    thickbarrel boughs, staunch presents</p>
    <p class="poemPara"> 
    pregazing, ante-hension<br>
    on the peripheries of disconnect, sensation, otherwise<br>
    all that soaked through, dismembered inclemence</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    hung stem to slice, the deviate fruiting<br>
    all over, hands pre-worn since daybreak<br>
    the earliest grip came strong, thumbridge, indent to burst</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    never sat knowing near enough<br>
    to meet and make in facing,<br>
    fruitful and unsought, instead</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    stress-tested an undeserving berry<br>
    on a stalk on a vine on a bench<br>
    in the corner in the way</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    in the unutterable salience of inattention<br>
    nearer nothing now, each expulsion<br>
    blue and red, to gloss our affections</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    forgive me this infirmity<br>
    as ever spilling, domed vials, luxuriating<br>
    in fluid misapprehension, the white strand</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    silvering distance, retreating, nether<br>
    the river and its occupants, damp-skinned,<br>
    squealing, unused to meticulous disposal<br>
    borne another decade into mortal knit and splitting</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    cascade to quotidian altar, foot meets ground<br>
    idolatrous stance, broad-shouldered,<br>
    hung in well-traveled crevasses, the garment<br>
    maintaining double aspect, more perhaps<br>
    mirroring subduction in the atmosphere</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    steam and doxa’s kisses sent on<br>
    filling hearts, genera and foolish ores<br>
    a fondness that curls around the waiting form<br>
    deposing memory and its forthcoming, afterthought</p>
    <p class="poemPara">
    said a young man to a young man<br>
    i’m an old man, full of regrets
  </p>
